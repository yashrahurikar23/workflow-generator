   │                        Header                               │
   │  🔄 Workflow Generator | Selected: [Workflow Name]          │
   ├─────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┤
   │             │                             │                 │
   │  Workflow   │     Workflow               │     Chat        │
   │  Sidebar    │   Visualization            │    Panel        │
   │             │                             │                 │
   │ - List      │  React Flow Diagram        │ - Messages      │
   │ - Select    │  - Nodes & Edges           │ - Input         │
   │ - Status    │  - Interactive             │ - Thread Info   │
   │             │                             │                 │
   └─────────────┴─────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘
   ```

   - Auto-selects first workflow on load

4. **Center Panel - Workflow Visualization**
   - Shows selected workflow using React Flow
   - Displays placeholder when no workflow selected
   - Interactive workflow diagram with step dependencies
   - Custom node types for different step types

5. **Right Sidebar - Chat Interface**
   - AI-powered chat system

   - Shows currently selected workflow name and status
   - Clean, professional appearance

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Component Integration:
- **WorkflowSidebar**: Enhanced with proper API integration and selection handling
- **WorkflowVisualization**: Integrated as the center panel component
- **ChatPanel**: Positioned as right sidebar with full height
- **App.tsx**: Orchestrates all components with shared state

#### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed useEffect dependency warning in WorkflowSidebar
- Removed duplicate code in fetchWorkflows function
- Cleaned up old App-old.tsx file causing TypeScript errors
- Enhanced error handling and loading states

#### State Management:
- Added selectedWorkflow state in App.tsx
- Proper workflow selection handling
- State synchronization between components

### 🎯 User Experience Enhancements

#### Navigation:
- Intuitive left-to-right workflow: Browse → Visualize → Chat
- Clear visual hierarchy with sidebars and main content
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

#### Visual Design:
- Professional header with app branding
- Clean separation between functional areas
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Status indicators and visual feedback

#### Interaction Flow:
1. User sees list of workflows on the left
2. Clicks to select a workflow
3. Workflow appears in center visualization
4. Header updates to show selected workflow
5. Chat remains available on the right for assistance

### 📱 Responsive Design Features
- Fixed sidebar widths (320px left, 384px right)
- Flexible center panel that adapts to screen size
- Proper scrolling in each panel
- Minimum width handling for content

### 🔄 API Integration Updates
- Workflow list loading from `/api/v1/workflows/`
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Loading states during data fetch
- Automatic workflow selection after load

## Technical Details

### Component Structure:
```typescript
App.tsx (Main Layout)
├── Header (Brand + Selected Workflow Info)
├── Main Layout (3-column flex)
│   ├── WorkflowSidebar (320px, workflow list)
│   ├── WorkflowVisualization (flex-1, React Flow)
│   └── ChatPanel (384px, chat interface)
```

### State Flow:
```typescript
App.tsx manages:
- selectedWorkflow: Workflow | null
- handleWorkflowSelect: (workflow: Workflow) => void

Propagated to:
- WorkflowSidebar: receives selectedWorkflow, calls onWorkflowSelect
- WorkflowVisualization: receives workflow prop
- ChatPanel: independent chat state
```

### CSS Classes Used:
- `min-h-screen bg-gray-50 flex flex-col` - Full height layout
- `w-80 border-r border-gray-200 bg-white flex-shrink-0` - Left sidebar
- `flex-1 min-w-0` - Center panel (flexible)
- `w-96 border-l border-gray-200 bg-white flex-shrink-0` - Right sidebar

## Validation & Testing

### ✅ Verified Working:
- React app compiles and runs successfully
- 3-column layout renders correctly
- Workflow list loads from backend API
- Workflow selection updates visualization
- Chat panel remains functional
- Responsive design adapts properly

### 🔧 Fixed Issues:
- Removed TypeScript errors from old files
- Fixed React Hook dependency warnings
- Resolved duplicate code in API calls
- Enhanced error handling

### 🎯 User Testing Flow:
1. Open http://localhost:3003
2. See workflow list on left sidebar ✅
3. Click workflow to select ✅
4. See workflow visualization in center ✅
5. Header updates with selected workflow ✅
6. Chat panel available on right ✅

## Files Modified

   - Show execution progress and results
   - Integrate with `/workflows/{id}/execute` endpoint

2. **Workflow Generation UI**
   - Add natural language input form
   - Integrate with `/workflows/generate` endpoint
   - Allow users to create workflows from descriptions

3. **Enhanced Chat Features**
   - Add thread switching functionality
   - Improve message formatting and display
   - Add workflow-related chat commands

### Technical Tasks:
1. Start backend server consistently
2. Add workflow execution status tracking
3. Implement real-time updates during execution
4. Add form validation and error handling

---

**Session Summary**: Successfully implemented a professional 3-column layout with workflow list, visualization, and chat. The app now provides an intuitive user experience for browsing, selecting, and visualizing workflows while maintaining access to the AI chat assistant. All components are properly integrated and the foundation is set for adding execution and generation features.
